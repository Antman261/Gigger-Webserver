            <h3>Our Verse</h3>
            <blockquote>
        		<p>Music is the medium through which we create meaning in a humbling universe.</p>

        		<p>In a world which otherwise forgets about us, music is the voice with which we shout <em>"I am here. I feel. I live. I love. I can stare into the void unafraid because I have felt passionately, lived hungrily, and loved foolishly."</em></p>

        		<p>A voice amongst the eternal chorus of humanity, it frees our individuality, yet reminds us we are not alone.</p>

        		<p>The right song at the right moment can unlock the truest depths of your lovers heart, heal a brutal sting, or inspire an unstoppable revolution.</p>

        		<p>Music is the blood that flows in the veins of our soul, and we would see it kept healthy. We would see it grow great with the honest song of an open heart.</p>

        		<p>We would hear you sing.</p>
